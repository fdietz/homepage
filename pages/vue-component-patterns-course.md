## Who is this course for?

This course is for everyone with a basic understanding of Vue.js who wants to learn more about using components effectively.

## Why you should learn more about components

Having build frontends in multiple frameworks, I'm fascinated by how all these frameworks converge on the very same idea of a reusable component.

And it really is a repeating pattern. You have a component which encapsulates state, logic and even styling. With props in and events out, you can use these components to compose complex UIs.

It is therefore well worth to invest more time in learning how to work with components effectively
